# Pattern-Recognition-Quizes

A collection of assignments from the Pattern Recognition class I took at AUTH.
The class was separated in 3 chapters: Data Preprocessing, Classification and Clustering
I collected the questions from each assignment/ quiz, gathered the corresponding code I had written and organized it so that the end result could help future
students understand the basic concepts behind these chapters, and also help them get a little more familiar with the code necessary for solving these types of excercises.
